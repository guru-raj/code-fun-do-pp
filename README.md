# Idea for codefundo++

### IOT Based Intelligent System

- The main idea about the system is to be able to monitor the changes in the environment and predict the possibility of occurrence of the disaster.
- The system will be IoT based, which will collect the data from sensor feed and store it in a database from time to time.
- The system which will monitor abnormalities in the sensor data feed will be first trained using previously available data and then it will keep learning based on continuous data it receives.
- The system will be trained using neural nets and the decision making will be made using fuzzy inference rules (as the prediction to be made is based on environment)
